**ESA SPACE ANOMALY DETECTION ALGORITHM**

This repository contains the code and data of algorithms for the detecting of the anomalies in spacecraft telemetry, based on real sensor measurements from a European Space Agency (ESA) mission. The project focuses on identifying anomalous time points in a multivariate time series dataset while minimizing false alarms. [Originated from a **Kaggle** challenge by **ESA**]

**Key Highlights**

**Evaluation Metric:** Uses a corrected event-wise F0.5 score, prioritizing precision over recall. Each anomalous segment is treated as a single event.
**Dataset:**
train.parquet: 14 years of annotated ESA-Mission1 data.
train.csv: 14 years of annotated ESA-Mission1 data, splitted in 3: train test (70%), validation set (15%) and test set (15%) [converted in .csv]
test.parquet: A 6-month unseen fragment for evaluation.
test.csv: A 6-month unseen fragment for evaluation [converted in .csv]
target_channels.csv: 58 monitored channels.
sample_submission.parquet: Format reference for submissions.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset represents several years of real sensor measurements collected from a large spacecraft operated by the European Space Agency. The reduced dataset has been used. It comprises only 6 channels (from 41 to 46), no telecommands and a full lenght of 1.000.000 rows.

The task of the Algorithms is to find all anomalous time points in the test set (binary decision, 0 - normal point, 1 - anomalous point) while minimizing the number of false alarms.

**Events to detect**

ESA-ADB dataset contains three categories of events: anomalies, nominal rare events, and communication gaps. The Algorithm's task is to detect both anomalies and rare nominal events.

**‚úÖ Goal**

Develop models that detect anomalies with high precision and compact detections, avoiding excessive false positives.
